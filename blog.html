                        Digital technologies have progressed faster than any other breakthrough in history,
                        reaching over half of the world's population in just two decades and altering society.
                        Technology can help to level the playing field through improving connection, financial
                        inclusion, trade access, and access to public services.
                        For example, AI-enabled frontier technologies in the health sector are assisting in the
                        saving of lives, the diagnosis of illnesses, and the extension of life expectancy. Virtual
                        learning environments and distant learning have offered up educational opportunities to
                        students who would otherwise be shut out. Through blockchain-powered platforms,
                        public services are becoming more accessible and accountable, as well as less
                        bureaucratically demanding as a result of AI support. Big data may also help
                        policymakers and programmers create more responsive and accurate policies and
                        programs.

                        The phrase "big data" refers to data collections that are both complicated and large in
                        size. Big data refers to information that may be studied to uncover hidden information
                        such as market trends, undiscovered relationships, patterns, client preferences, and so
                        on. Big data is a term that refers to the process of gathering, cleaning, and analyzing
                        enormous volumes of data for organizations to make educated decisions. Traditional
                        data processing apps cannot handle big data. Big data is no longer novel to businesses
                        and society in the age of information and advanced analytics. Big data has been around
                        for a long time. Organizations produce insights and make well-informed decisions, find
                        patterns, and enhance productivity with big data solutions, it is widely known.
                        Big data, on the other hand, is more than that. Big data offers organizations several
                        benefits and has an influence on enterprises, the workforce, and society.
